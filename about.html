        <p>
          This is my personal website and is a great tool of creation for the
          purpose of learning new web development skills alongside applying the
          practical knowledge I already have. So far I learned about flexbox, a
          little bit of javascript, and several concepts in CSS. I will be
          combining all this knowledge and applying it to the creation and
          progressive development of this website. Stay tuned for further
          changes and additions in the future.
