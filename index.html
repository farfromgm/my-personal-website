          <h3>Welcome to my personal project!</h3>
          <p>
            In this project, I will demonstrate and apply the knowlege I have
            with html, CSS, and Javascript. I like to use the same logic with
            chess that I do with coding, and it involves planning and strategic
            thinking. Being able to solve issues and put things together with
            code feels quite rewarding!
